Prisms, traversals, and zipper for the `Json` type. Part of the [Argonaut](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut) collection of libraries for working with JSON in PureScript.

## Installation

Install `argonaut-traversals` with [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago):

```sh
spago install argonaut-traversals
```

or install as part of the Argonaut bundle:

```sh
spago install argonaut
```

## Quick start

You can use the prisms defined in `Data.Argonaut.Prisms` with functions from the [`profunctor-lenses`](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-profunctor-lenses) library to work with nested `Json` structures. For example:

```js
// FFI file
exports.sampleJson = { "a": { "b" [ 10, 11, 12 ] } }
```

```purs
import Prelude

import Effect (Effect)
import Data.Argonaut.Core (Json, jsonParser)
import Data.Argonaut.Prisms (_Array, _Number, _Object)
import Data.Maybe (Maybe(..))
import Data.Lens (preview)
import Data.Lens.Index (ix)
import Effect.Console (log)

foreign import sampleJson :: Json

main :: Effect Unit
main =
  -- Walk through an object at the key 'a', then an object at the key 'b', then
  -- get the first index of an array as a number.
  case preview (_Object <<< ix "a" <<< _Object <<< ix "b" <<< _Array <<< ix 0 <<< _Number) json of
    Nothing -> log "nothin' there"
    Just v -> log $ "This should be 10.0 " <> show v
```

You may also be interested in other libraries in the Argonaut ecosystem:

- [purescript-argonaut-core](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-core) defines the `Json` type, along with basic parsing, printing, and folding functions
- [purescript-argonaut-codecs](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs) provides codecs based on `EncodeJson` and `DecodeJson` type classes, along with instances for common data types and combinators for encoding and decoding `Json` values.
- [purescript-codec-argonaut](https://github.com/garyb/purescript-codec-argonaut) supports an alternative approach for codecs, which are based on profunctors instead of type classes.
- [purescript-argonaut-generic](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-generic) supports generic encoding and decoding for any type with a `Generic` instance.

## Documentation

`argonaut-traversals` documentation is stored in a few places:

1. Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-argonaut-traversals).
2. Written documentation and [the changelog](./docs/CHANGELOG.md) are kept in [the docs directory](./docs).
3. Usage examples can be found in [the test suite](./test).

If you get stuck, there are several ways to get help:
